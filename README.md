These are homeworks for computation physics in Technion
comp are questions of homeworks  
CompHW are my answers and codes of homeworks  
## comp4
Solving partial differential equation by FTCS method, Lax method ,and Leap-fog method.
## comp5
Solving "a charge in the box or on the surface" and "A box in a box" by numerical method.
## comp6
Solving retarded time questions by numerical method.
## comp7
First, I solve Voigt integration by Trapezoidal method and Romberg Integration.  
Second, I find the value of PI by Monte Carlo and Evenly Spaced Points.  
Finally, I create huge times of colliding events and see whether or not the distribution fits Maxwell Boltzmann distribution.
